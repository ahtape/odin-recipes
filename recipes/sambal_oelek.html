    <h2>What is Sambal Oelek Red Chili Paste?</h2>
    <p>In the Indonesian language, the word “sambal” means chili paste, and the word “oelek” means ground with a moljacete. Traditionally, sambal oelek is made with freshly ground red chili peppers and as such, is often spicier than the typical chili sauce like Sriracha.</p>
    <p>When I lived in Indonesia, my housekeeper made sambal oelek using a moljacete fresh every week. And let me tell you: we’d eat every bit of her delicious sambal by the end of the week! Trust me, once you try making your own sambal oelek, there’s no going back! This Indonesian red chili paste adds so much flavor to anything you add it to, and is SO easy to make.</p>
    <p>Of course, you can buy Sambal Oelek from your local grocery store like Walmart. But, once you realize how simple and quick it is to make on your own Sambal Oelek, there’s no reason you’ll buy the storebought red chili paste ever again!</p>
    <p>Sambal Oelek Red Chili Paste is naturally gluten-free, dairy-free, and vegan.</p>
